# ENGS110_2020-Project
This application is aimed at students, who want to broaden their knowledge in their favourite science subject.
It grants the user access to a database of problems. Initially, the app comes preloaded with a few problems from each category (with their solutions). Later, each user can add their own one to the list. The application can be used by multiple users from the same computer, and therefore, if a problem is not solved yet, any user can add a solution underneath. 
After succsessful creation of the offline version I hope to make the application online (e.g. it can be downloaded on multiple computers so that each change by one user will be seen by others across multiple computers). However, I am not sure if I'll manage to make the online version before the end of the semester.
